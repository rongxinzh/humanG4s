# humanG4s

This repository contains predicted G-quadruplex (G4) sequence coordinates in the human genome using the G4Hunter software under the genome assembly of **hg19**.
The prediction threshold for G4Hunter was set to a window size of 25bp and a score of 1.5.

## Files
`G4Hunter_window25_score1.5.txt`: the coordinates of the predicted G-quadruplex sequences in the human genome.
This file consists of 9 columns, each representing the chromosome number, start and end coordinates of the G4 sequence, length of the G4 sequence, strand information, score, maximum score, score threshold, and window threshold.
Please note that the file only includes the 22 autosomes and the X chromosome.

## Usage
To use the predicted G-quadruplex coordinates in your research or analysis, you can download the `G4Hunter_window25_score1.5.txt` file from this repository.
The current parameter settings are optimal, as discussions with Jean-Louis Mergny. However, if you have your own sequences and wish to customize the predictions, we recommend using the online version of the G4Hunter program.
